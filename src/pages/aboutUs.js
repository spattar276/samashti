        We are passionate young at heart entrepreneurs, Engineers, Farmers and Volunteers from various backgrounds who have taken up this cause after seeing the struggle of farmers during COVID and want to make a difference in their lives.  Also the extensive use of pesticides and fertilizers made us think about slowly transitioning farmers to sustainable growing methods.
            As we are all aware, agriculture and farming constitute 20% percent of our GDP.  Our nation’s development lies in the villages and if people in the villages are happy then the development that happens around it will be sustainable and we can mitigate the problem of mass migration to cities or urban areas.
            Lack of Organic Farming knowledge, basic know how, assistance and initial help are all missing for many farmers and we at Samashti want to address this problem and would want to collectively work with several players in the market to facilitate bringing the required help for the farmers.
            Samashti was started during COVID seeing the struggles of the farmers trying to live through this tough time with regard to finance, loans, supply chain, better pricing.
            Samashti’s aim is to work collectively with all the relevant sections of society that will make farmers’ life easy, sustainable and will make them proud of their profession.
            Farming is a very low paying job for many marginal farmers. It is also very difficult profession because of various factors like weather, soil, irrigation, labour, market access and better price for their produce.  This is causing a lot of the younger generation to migrate to urban areas looking for better life. Also, following organic practice is very difficult because of pest and other problems, so they opt for inorganic way of farming by which they erode the soil fertility causing harm in the longer run.

            Samashti wants to change that perspective and wants to make farmer feel proud of their profession and also want them to happily convert to organic farming with ease.
            Samashti’s vision is to transform every village into a self-sustainable village in the near future.
            As the name suggests, Samashti means collective existence.  To start with, we have adopted a small village () a and the farmers in that village and we plan do the transition farmers in that village toward sustainable organic farming.

            We have started our work by collaborating with BERU (Back to Roots), a community organization which has been working with several farmers from that village for the past 2 years.
            BERU is run by three young vibrant farmer entrepreneurs who left their plush IT jobs and settled in that village. They have been helping farmers to convert to organic farmers by teaching them the knowhow, and creating market access for their product at better price. Due to shortage of funds and other logistics, it is taking longer than expected and now Samashti is helping them by raising funds.
